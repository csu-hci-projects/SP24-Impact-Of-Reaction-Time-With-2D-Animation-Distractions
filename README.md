# SP24-Impact-Of-Reaction-Time-With-2D-Animation-Distractions

# Project Description

The project we have created tests user reaction time with 2D animations. The application sets up a grid, where the user must find the odd element out, with a total of 361 elements on the screen. Users must complete levels 1-9, where each level increases in difficulty as they progress through the study. The user times are the dependent variable, while 2D animations are the independent variable. Time is tracked and will be analyzed to determine whether the animations affected the user or not.

## Required Libraries

To run the program, you must have the following libraries installed:

- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy
- random
- textwrap
- matplotlib.patches
- time
- matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation
- sys
- matplotlib.patches.Circle

## Running the Program

You can run the program using either Python 2 or Python 3. The commands are as follows:

- Python 2: `python <file.py>`
- Python 3: `python3 <file.py>`
