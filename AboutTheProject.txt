For this project, we wanted to see if 2D animations on a 20x20 grid would have an impact on reaction time. As a small 2 person group,
we would meet twice a week before class to discuss progress, ideas, and more about the project.

What each person completed:

Ryan: 
* Checkpoint 1: Did about 50% of it, edited it as well.
* Wrote the code for the project.
* Got 10 Participants.
* COntributed evenly to the writing the research paper.

Yilong:

There were some small challenges from a coding perspective. Though i had used python a lot before, I never messed with any of the animations
and elements like that, so it was a bit of a challenge to get the initial screen popup, grid, and really just the functionality of it since
there was user input needed.
