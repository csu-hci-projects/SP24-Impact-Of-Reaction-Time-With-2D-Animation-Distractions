The project that we have created tests user reaction time with 2D
animations. The application sets up a grid, where the user must find the
odd element out, which there is a total of 361 elements on the screen.
The user must complete levels 1-9, where each level increases increases
in difficulty as they progress through the study. The user times are the dependent
variable, where 2D animations are the independent variable. Time is tracked, and
will then be analyzed to determine whether the animations effected the user or not.

To run the program, you must have all the required libraries installed. Those include:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import random
import textwrap
import matplotlib.patches as patches
import time
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
import sys
from matplotlib.patches import Circle

You can run it with python 2 or python 3, and that goes as followed:
python 2: python <file.py>
python 3: python3 <file.py>
